# DeepMPF: Deep Learning Framework for Predicting Drug-Target Interactions based on Multi-Modal Representation with Meta-Path Semantic Analysis
A multi-modal representation framework of DTI prediction 



## Data details
This paper includes four comparison datasets that enzymes, G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), ion channels and nuclear receptors collected from reference [1] . Each dataset file contains the three modal information and expanded information of disease domain.  Furthermore, There are examples of saving models each fold in the path of " Example/draw/metaPath/ '*dataset name*' /  '*method*.h5' ".
